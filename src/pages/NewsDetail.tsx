        <h2>Understanding Teen Mental Health</h2>
        <p>Our research team recently completed a major study examining factors that support mental health and resilience in adolescents. The findings provide valuable insights for families, educators, and healthcare providers.</p>

        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Strong peer relationships are a primary protective factor</li>
          <li>Physical activity shows significant correlation with mental wellbeing</li>
          <li>Family communication and support remain critically important</li>
          <li>School engagement is linked to better overall mental health outcomes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What This Means</h3>
        <p>These findings support existing recommendations for holistic teen health support that addresses physical, social, and emotional wellbeing.</p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>Our team is developing practical resources for families and schools based on this research. Stay tuned for free educational materials launching next month.</p>
